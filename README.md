Emails Input standalone component
======================
#### Frontend test assesment

Emails Input is a reusable component created to provide an easy way to collect emails.

[Simple Demo page](https://rzhigalov.github.io/miro-emails-input/)

### Minimal Setup

1. Download minified script version:  
   [emails-input.min.js](https://github.com/rzhigalov/miro-emails-input/blob/master/emails-input.min.js)
2. Add script tag to your page  
   ```html
   <script src="emails-input.min.js" defer type="text/javascript"></script>
   ```
3. Add container element in your markup  
   ```html
   <div id="emails-input"></div>
   ```
4. Add initializing function  
    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      var options = {
        // Configuration is optional and described in the section below
      };
      var inputContainerNode = document.querySelector('#emails-input');
      var emailsInput = EmailsInput(inputContainerNode, options);
    });
    ```
5. Enjoy using the component


### Component behaviour
EmailsInput component is initialized by `EmailsInput(elementNode, options)` call.  
* It will create all internal markup on initialization.  
* Stylesheet is prefixed and inserted into the document upon EmailsInput initialization (once per prefix). If this is not a desired behaviour for you, see `embedCSS` option.
* Invalid emails are accepted, but will have different styling and `valid:false` flag in returned collection.
* Email blocks are created by pressing Enter, entering coma or by loosing focus on the input field.  
* Pasted emails are converted into blocks immediately. If input had any value it will be prepended to input value.
* Email blocks may be removed by clicking the cross icon or by calling public API methods (see `replaceAll` or `reset`)
* It is possible to create multiple EmailsInput on one page ‚Äì they are not interfering with each other and will have unique internal ids.


### Public methods

EmailsInput function returns component instance. It provides following public methods and properties:  
* `container` ‚Äì reference to parent HTML element passed as the first parameter
* `getValues()` ‚Äì returns collection of emails with following signature:
   ```js
    {
      value: string,      // Email value.
      valid: boolean,     // Email validity flag based on options.pattern
      renderedId: string  // Internal rendered id. 
                          // Can be used to query element as `[data-item-id]="renderedId"`
    }
   ```
* `add(emails)` ‚Äì Add one or more emails. `emails` can be passed as a string with comma separated values or array of strings.
* `replaceAll(emails)` ‚Äì Replace all entered emails with new ones. `emails` can be passed as a string with comma separated values or array of strings.
* `reset()` ‚Äì Reset EmailsInput state. Removes all emails.
* `subscribe(cb)` ‚Äì Register callback function to be triggered on `EmailsInput.items` change. Will invoke callback as `cb(items)` (see `getValues()` for items signature)

Container element will receive Custom Event `emailsinputchange` so you can subscribe to value changes using [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Corresponding values will be passed in `Event.detail` property.


### Configuration
EmailsInput can be configured with `options` object passed as a second argument to initializer.  
##### List of configuration options (everything is optional):
* `pattern` _string_ or _RegExp_ ‚Äì Pattern against which email validity is tested.  
  Defaults to relaxed pattern, that allows special symbols in _name_ part of emails.  
  **Default**: ```/^[\w.%+-/!#$%&'*=?^_`{|}~]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/```  
  Can be set to validate against domains (e.g. `/.*@github.com$/`)
* `embedCSS` _boolean_ ‚Äì Enables runtime stylesheet embedding.  
  Set to `false` if you prefer handling your stylesheets manually. In that case you will need to link [emails-input.min.css stylesheet](https://github.com/rzhigalov/miro-emails-input/blob/master/emails-input.min.css) or provide a custom one.  
  **Default**: `true`
* `cssNamespace` _string_ ‚Äì CSS classes prefix. Use to avoid styles collision. **Disabled by default**
* `autofocus` _boolean_ ‚Äì Enforces [autofocus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-autofocus) attribute on input. Use with caution. **Disabled by default**
* `autocomplete` _boolean_ ‚Äì Enables autocomplete on input. **Disabled by default**
* `maxLength` _number_ ‚Äì Sets max length restriction on input. **Disabled by default**
* `placeholder` _string_ ‚Äì Input's placeholder attribute.  
  **Default**: `add email by typing here`
* `maxHeight` _number_ or _string_ ‚Äì EmailsInput max height restriction. If passed as number will treat value as px. Set to _'auto'_ if you want input to grow as values add.  
  **Default**: `96px` via stylesheet
* `minHeight` _number_ or _string_ ‚Äì EmailsInput min height restriction. If passed as number will treat value as px. Set to _'auto'_ if you want input to collapse into 1 line.  
  **Default**: `96px` via stylesheet 


### FAQ
1. What is browser support for this component?  
   Last 2 versions of every major browser is supported. And **IE 11**.  
   And _probably_ IE 10, but I have no chance to test it  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2. Will multiple instances of EmailsInput conflict with each other?  
   No. Every instance is isolated and provides globally unique internal ids.

3. I want my EmailInputs to look differently on one page. Do I need to write complex CSS overrides?  
   No, you don't have to. You can use `cssNamespace` to prevent collision and disable `embedCSS` to use your own stylesheet ‚Äì feel free to use [emails-input.css stylesheet](https://github.com/rzhigalov/miro-emails-input/blob/master/emails-input.css) as a reference!

4. My email is valid, but this component says it's not. Should I create an issue?  
   No need to. [There is no perfect email regex](http://emailregex.com/), but you are free to change this behaviour by chaging `options.pattern`.

5. Why there are no tests?  
   Because I am still thinking on how to test _not only_ the public API, but perform tests on internals granulary withouth breaking existing closure construct. If for some reason you need this component for production, please [create an issue](https://github.com/rzhigalov/miro-emails-input/issues) so I know you need tests.

6. How can I receive changes without checking `getValues()`?  
   There are two ways to achieve that:  
   1. Setup EventListener on EmailsInput node  
      ```html
      <div id="emails-input"></div>
      ...
      <script>
        var inputContainerNode = document.querySelector('#emails-input');
        inputContainerNode.addEventListener('emailsinputevent', function(inputEvt) {
          const emails = inputEvt.details;
          // Process received emails (objects)
        }, false);
      </script>
      ```
   2. _Subscribe_ to value changes by using callback(s). Every callback will be invoked on every EmailsInput value changes.  
      ```js
      var emailsInput = EmailsInput(inputContainerNode, options);
      emailsInput.subscribe(function(emailItems) {
        // Process received emails (objects)
      });
      ```

7. When I change _font-size_ everything changes its size. Is it broken?  
   No, it's intended to behave this way. If you want EmailsInput not to change make sure you don't change font-size on root emails input. It looks best at 14px, but scales gracefully.

8. Do I have to use `defer` attribute for script?  
   No, but it is better for your page's load.

9. Can I use it with TypeScript?  
   Well, why not? This component lacks `d.ts` files, but annotated with JSDoc, so we can generate missing files in a minute!

10. Can I use npm to install this package?  
   No, sorry. This component was created for demo purposes.

11. What is the purpose of this component, if this is not production ready?  
    This is a Frontend test assesment for one of my pre-interviews.
